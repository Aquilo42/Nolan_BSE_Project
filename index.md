# Guesture Controlled Robot
My Project is a guesture controlled robot. This project has two seperate parts, the robot, and the controller. The robot part of this project has 4 wheels and can drive around. The controller uses a bluetooth conection to the robot to tell it what to do, which is decided by the controller based on an accelerometr that is used to detect the motion of the controller. This means that by moving the controller in a certain way, you will be able to move the robot.

# Final Milestone
For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

# Second Milestone
For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone

# First Milestone
My first milestone was getting the robot part of the project to work. This involved attaching the motors, wheels, arduino, battery pack, and motor driver board to the chassis. I then had to correctly connect all of the parts together with wires. The hardest part about connecting the wires was finding the correct place to connect each wire. This is due to the fact that the motors are not oriented in the exact same way on the chassis so when attatching the wires I had to account for the orientation of the motor relative to all of the other motors. I then connected the arduino to my computer and was able to run code that made the robot drive. A challenge that I am going to have to solve in future milestones is the wiring of my robot. The wires are currently bent around eachother in loops to connect. This can lead to malfunctions due to the wires not touching eachother correctly. To solve this I need to sauter the wires into their correct places but this may prove a challenge because I have never sautered anything before.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
